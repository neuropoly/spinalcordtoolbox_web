Some library are needed to have the server running they are include in the setup.py file
Runnig 'python setup.py develop' should install all that you need in your virtual environement
Did not forget to add the package you add for additional developpement in the setup.py file


You need nodeJS to be installed so potential js goodies will work, the database is sqlite3, do not ferget to have that install too.


lib that need to be there to compyle numpy, scipy, matplotlib...
libfreetype6 
libfreetype6-dev
lapack
gfortran
gcc
etc...
would be good to hav a .deb that do all that
